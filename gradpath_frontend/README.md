# gradpath_frontend

A new Flutter project.

## College Scorecard API (US schools + majors)

This app uses the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard API for school
and major search. For production use, **do not** commit the API key. Pass it via
`--dart-define` when running or building.

Example:

```
flutter run --dart-define=COLLEGE_SCORECARD_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

You can obtain a key at https://api.data.gov/signup/.
